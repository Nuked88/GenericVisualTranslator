# :video_game: :headphones: :rocket: Generic Visual Translator :rocket: :headphones: :video_game:
**GVT** is a generic translation tool for parts of text on the PC screen with Text to Speech functionality.
I wanted to create it because the existing tools that I experimented with did not satisfy me in ease-to-use experience and configuration.
Personally I used it with Lost Ark (example included generated by 2k monitor) to translate simple dialogues of quests in Italian.

## :memo:Requirements

Tested Operating Systems : **Windows 10/11**
Python Version: **3.9.6**

- Easynmt
- OpenCV2
- Easyocr
- Numpy
- Deepl (Unofficial API)
- Pyttsx3
- Pywin32
- WXWidgets
- Pygame
- Keyboard

The `requirements.txt` file has been created with the versions currently installed on my pc, but it is not excluded that **GVT** could work also with newer or older versions of the same libraries

**Requirements installation command**
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## :muscle:How it works

**GVT** simply translates a user-defined region of the screen and then recites it using Windows 10/11 TTS (Not tested on Windows 7) showing the translated text instead of the one on the screen.

Before using it, you need to configure the `config.yaml` file in the same folder.

Then you can run **GVT** using `run.bat` or with the command `python main.py`.

## :rocket:Getting started

This is an example based on the LostArk video game
- Clone this repository on your pc or download the folder and enter in it
- Launch LostArk and reach a dialogue scene
- Run `runCoordHelper.bat` or the command `python GetCoords.py`
- Press <kbd>Z</kbd> on the upper left point of the text box
- Press <kbd>Z</kbd> on the lower right point of the text box
- Copy the coordinates from the console instead of the empty fields in the `config.yaml` file under the` main_region` and close the console
- Find the dot or icon that appears whenever the text to be translated also appears, in the case of LostArk it is the `Leave` button at the bottom right
- Press the <kbd> Shift </kbd> + <kbd> Win </kbd> + <kbd> S </kbd> buttons on Windows 10 or 11 and select this image and save it later in the ** activators ** folder with a recognizable name
- Run `runCoordHelper.bat` again or the command` python GetCoords.py
- Use the same method as above to get the coordinates of a not too narrow box surrounding the ** activator ** in-game image
- Copy the coordinates from the console and paste it instead of the empty fields in the `config.yaml` file under the` activator_region` and close the console 
- Set the `source_language` with the acronym of the language you want to translate from, and the `target_language` for the language you want to translate the game into (use https://github.com/ptrstn/deepl-translate for the reference table and languages supported by deepl or go here https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP for opus models)
- Set the dialog progress key if desired, otherwise leave it at `None`. **Note:** Leave to `None` if your game have a heavy anti-cheat system that not allow anything except you to press the keys of your keyboard
- Set `show_text` and `tts_enabled` according to what you want enabled/disabled
- If you have set `tts_enabled` to `True`, `run runVoiceList.bat` or  `python voice_list.py` to find out the number matched to the voices installed in your Windows distribution (is the one in the square parentheses) and set the variable `tts_voice_number` to the desired number.

```

- Execute `run.bat`

## :thought_balloon:To Do
- Add the capability to change the font size and style of the subtitle
- Add the capability to define more regions and activator at once
- Add the capability to support multiple game just chosing it from a menu
